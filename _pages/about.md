I am an Assistant Professor of [Operations Management](https://business.rice.edu/faculty-research/research/operations-management) at [Rice University, Jones Graduate School of Business](https://business.rice.edu/). 

Previously, I received my PhD from Stanford University, where I was part of the [Operations Research](https://or.stanford.edu/) group in the [Department of Management Science and Engineering](https://msande.stanford.edu/). I was advised by [Benjamin Van Roy](https://web.stanford.edu/~bvr/) and [Kuang Xu](https://gsb-faculty.stanford.edu/kuang-xu/). Before coming to Stanford, I received a B.A. degree in mathematics with a minor in economics and a minor in management sciences from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). 

Research Interests
======

I design and analyze **continual learning** agents, machine learning agents that can continually acquire knowledge to tackle **decision making** challenges over an extended lifetime. To this end, I leverage tools from probability theory, stochastic modeling, information theory, etc. I also work to specialize agent design principles to specific **applications in operations**, such as recommendation systems, developing algorithms that are efficient and scalable.
