I am a fifth-year PhD candidate at Stanford University, where I’m part of the Operations Research group in the [Department of Management Science and Engineering](https://msande.stanford.edu/). I’m advised by [Benjamin Van Roy](https://web.stanford.edu/~bvr/) and [Kuang Xu](http://web.stanford.edu/~kuangxu/). Previously, I received a B.A. degree in mathematics with a minor in economics and a minor in management sciences from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 

Research Interests
======
My research interest lies in decision-making under uncertainty. In particular, I use tools from probability theory and information theory to gain insight in agent design and analysis.
