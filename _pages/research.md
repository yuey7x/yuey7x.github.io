Algorithms and Theory
======
* **Yueyang Liu**, Xu Kuang, and Benjamin Van Roy, [Non-Stationary Bandit Learning via Predictive Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01970), 2022.
  * "Thompson sampling and its variants with sliding window, discounting of past rewards, or perioridc restart, do not work well in non-stationary environments."    
  * A preliminary version appears in International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS) 2023.
  * Under review at *Management Science*.
* **Yueyang Liu**, Xu Kuang, and Benjamin Van Roy, [A Definition of Non-Stationary Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12202), 2023.
  * "We propose a definition of non-stationarity, which resolves the ambiguity that arises in the literature."
  * To be submitted to *Management Science*.
* **Yueyang Liu**, Adithya M. Devraj, Benjamin Van Roy, and Kuang Xu, [Gaussian Imagination in Bandit Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01902), 2022.
  * "Bayesian agents remain effective when instantiated with sufficiently diffuse Gaussian prior and likelihood distributions."     
  * To be submmitted. 

Empirical and Applied Work 
======
* Zheqing Zhu, **Yueyang Liu**, Kuang Xu, and Benjamin Van Roy, [Non-Stationary Contextual Bandit Learning via Neural Predictive Ensemble Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07786), 2023.
  * "We design the first algorithm that is both scalable and prioritizes lasting information, based on deep neural networks. Experiments with real-world recommendation systems data show that our method achieves SOTA."   
  * Submitted.
